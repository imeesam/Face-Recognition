# Face-Recognition

A real-time face recognition system built using Python and OpenCV! 🚀

With the power of computer vision, this project can:

📸 Detect Faces: Identify faces in images or real-time video streams.<br>
🔍 Recognize Faces: Automatically recognize known faces and label them accordingly.<br>
📊 Track Faces: Continuously track the movement of faces within a video or webcam feed.<br>
🔒 Security Applications: Implement secure access systems using facial recognition technology.<br>
🌐 Integration: Easily integrate with other applications or systems.<br>
